import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I‚Äôm a <Underlining highlight>Front End Developer</Underlining> based in INDIA. Passionate about <Underlining highlight>building websites, web applications</Underlining>, and <Underlining highlight>cloud computing</Underlining>. Love to build web projects that are performant, accessible, and have a great user experience. I love learning so I‚Äôm always keeping up to
date by doing random side projects (wasiting too much money on
buying domain names), watching dev talks, and reading medium,
quora, blog posts.

My coding journey started unexpectedly in my 12th age. Started
coding in <Underlining highlight>python‚Äôs</Underlining> turtle library then moved on to build a basic website and I thought writing code was so cool :). I was hooked on computers and <Underlining highlight>web development</Underlining> so I pursued my degree in Information Technology. I‚Äôve been working in the industry since joining the college in 2019. Solely developed
several portfolio websites, information websites, and
eCommerce websites as a freelancer. Collaborated with other
developers to build projects. Worked as a Jr. web developer at
creative web agencies in part-time and so on.

Outside of work I love <Underlining highlight>cycling</Underlining> and <Underlining highlight>trekking</Underlining> in the mountains, going to street shops, <Underlining highlight>watching MMA</Underlining>, and being <Underlining highlight>outdoors</Underlining>.
