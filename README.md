This is the first iteration of my personal website. The project is under ongoing development. However, feel free to use it as a basis for your own portfolio - please just read the note below first. And if you find any bugs or improvements, let me know!

## Note
I've made my portfolio open source for your inspiration. I think, especially for beginners, it can be hard to get a first starting point. So feel free to build your portfolio up on mine. However, if you do so, please leave a tiny hint on your site that links to my site [iruthaya.dev](https://iruthaya.netlify.app/) or this [GitHub project](https://github.com/iruthayasanthose/gatsby-personal-portfolio). Thanks and happy coding!
